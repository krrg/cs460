# Lab: Routing

In this lab you will implement a distance vector routing protocol for
Bene, so that it can dynamically route packets across an arbitrary
network of simulated nodes. You will use the simulator to examine the
correctness and performance of your implementation.

## Distance Vector Routing

Simulate a distance vector routing protocol running on each node. It should
include the following features:

* Each node should start out knowing only about itself. 

* Nodes should communicate with their neighbors using broadcast packets
  with a TTL of 1, so they are sent only to their neighbors.

* Nodes periodically send a distance vector to their neighbors using
  broadcast. The distance vector lists the currently known destinations
  (starting out with only the node itself), and the shortest distance to
  each destination. A node stores the latest distance vector from each
  of its neigbors.

* Upon receiving a distance vector from a neighbor, a node examines
  each destination and compares its current best distance to the one
  received from its neighbor, plus one. If the neighbor's distance
  plus one is less than its current best distance, it records the new
  best distance and marks this neighbor as the next hop to the
  destination.

* Whenever the next hop changes for a destination, the node updates its
  forwarding table entry for that destination.

To implement the protocol, you should create a routing application 
that handles broadcast packets that use the "dvrouting" protocol field
in the packet header.

## Experiments

To demonstrate that your routing protocol works, you should run
experiments showing:

* A simple line of five nodes in a row, and packets can be sent from
  any node to any other node.

* A ring of five nodes, and packets can be sent from any node to any
  other node, with shortest paths always being used. Take a link down
  and show that the routes adjust accordingly.

* A general mesh of 15 nodes, with various packets being forwarded
  correctly. Take a link down, show the routes change, and then put
  the link back up and show the routes go back.

* An example of a counting-to-infinity problem. You do not need to
  solve it with poison reverse.

For each of these examples, show a trace of the routing protocol so
that you can demonstrate how it works, plus a trace of the nodes as
they forward a packet correctly.

## Report

Write a formal, scientific report that includes the following:

* Routing Protocol: Describe in detail how you implemented the distance
  vector routing protocol.

* Experiments: Demonstrate that your routing protocol works correctly,
  using the experiments described above.

Write using a formal, scientific report style. Your report should be
written as if you are explaining your work to another CS student, and
they need all of the details of what you did so that they can
replicate your experiments.

Your report can be any length, as long as you thoroughly describe your
project and results. The paper must use 11 point type, single spacing,
and one column per page.

You must use LaTex to write your report. You can use [this
template](https://github.com/zappala/latex-report-template) for your
report. To help you learn LaTeX, I suggest using the [WikiBooks LaTex
reference](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

## Submission

Your code should be located in a directory called lab4 in the top level:

<pre>
bene/
  src/
  examples/
  lab4/
</pre>

Turn in a tarball that includes all of your code (for the simulator,
experiments, graphing, etc), and a PDF of your report:

<pre>
tar -czvf bene.tgz bene
</pre>

using Learning Suite.

## Grading

This lab is worth 100 points, and will be graded with the following rubric:

* 50 points: A good effort to simulate routing but it doesn't work properly.

* 75 points: Routing works for some simple cases and the report does a
  thorough job of explaining how the routing protocol works.

* 100 points: All the experiments work and the report does a thorough
  job of explaining how the routing protocol works.

To get full points, all experiments must work well and the report must
be complete and written with a scientific style.
